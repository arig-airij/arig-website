      <description>Life as a researcher in Japan This text is by Claudio Feliciani Click here for the Italian version.
Life in Japan Beyond the aspects related to the working environment and the research world one should be reminded that as a researcher in Japan you will have to live in a very particular country, with traditions and customs often very different from Italy (and generally from Europe and western countries). This section aims at providing some suggestions and practical information regarding the daily life in Japan to people who intend to live and work in Japan.</description>

      <description>Life as a researcher in Japan Questo testo è stato scritto da Claudio Feliciani Clicka here for the English version.
La vita in Giappone Oltre agli aspetti legati al mondo della ricerca e del lavoro occorre tenere conto che in quanto ricercatore in Giappone ci si troverà a vivere in un paese molto particolare, con usanze e tradizioni spesso molto diverse dall’Italia (o generalmente dall’Europa o paesi occidentali). Questa sezione vuole dare qualche consiglio e fornire qualche informazione pratica riguardo alla vita quotidiana in Giappone a persone che intendono o hanno in previsione di vivere e lavorare in Giappone.</description>
