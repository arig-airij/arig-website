      <description>Life as a researcher in Japan Questo testo è stato scritto da Claudio Feliciani Clicka here for the English version.
La vita in Giappone Oltre agli aspetti legati al mondo della ricerca e del lavoro occorre tenere conto che in quanto ricercatore in Giappone ci si troverà a vivere in un paese molto particolare, con usanze e tradizioni spesso molto diverse dall’Italia (o generalmente dall’Europa o paesi occidentali). Questa sezione vuole dare qualche consiglio e fornire qualche informazione pratica riguardo alla vita quotidiana in Giappone a persone che intendono o hanno in previsione di vivere e lavorare in Giappone.</description>
